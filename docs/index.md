# Introduction

The purpose of this disctionary is three-fold:

1. Investigate the most urgent gaps in the available lexicon and propose solutions for them. For that we compare eldamo's material with Routledge "A Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary American English";
1. Provide a more thourough English > Quenya gloss by comparing available glosses with [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition)'s definitions;
1. Create space to collect and better document the neologisms created for *Alice in Wonderland* project.

## How Words Are Selected

1. If the gram has a corresponding late period gloss, it is given on the blue background
	+ if several glosses appear, the dating must be provided
		+ based on several factors, given the gloss values are the same, one should be preferred: NQ x &larr; LQ x &sc; y
	+ if a gloss appears in late period, but it corresponds to the gram only in earlier period, it is given with [**edited**] label, given the root value stayed semantically similar, and the added translations are highlighted in orange
		+ when an earlier root includes the values of a later root and the gloss, the later root is extended to comprise the earlier root values: NQ √X &larr; LQ √X &sube; EQ √Y  
		+ when an earlier root includes the values of the gloss, but not of a later root, and the later root is in semantic proximity of the early root, their values are combined: NQ √X &larr; LQ √X &cup; EQ √Y  
	+ if only the middle period gloss exists, but its root appears or is assume to be present in late period, no additional label will be given except the dating
		+ if adopting a gloss from a different (sister) language results in the existing gloss, it's assumed that the existing gloss is extended to comprise the sister-language gloss, and the [**edited**] label is required: NQ x &hArr; x &isin; √X &cup; SL y &isin; √X
1. If the gloss needs to be derived from a root which value corresponds to the gram, it is given on the orange background
	+ if the gloss exists, but only from a different (sister) language, it might be adopted with required changes: NQ x &isin; √X &larr; SL y &isin; √X
1. If the early period gloss is derived in a substantially different way, its alternative might be provided on the red background for completeness sake: NQ x &isin; √X &larr; EQ y &isin; {√Y &rArr; LQ √X}
	


## Abbreviations

In deriving the neologisms the following notation can appear:

+ A &rArr; B 'A resulted in B'<br>
+ A &sc; B 'A is preferred over B'<br>
+ A &sub; B 'A is a set of B'<br>
+ A &sube; B 'A is a set of B, and is extended to B'<br>
+ A &subne; B 'A is a set of B, and cannot be extended to B'<br>
+ A &larr; B 'A adopted from B'<br>
+ A &hArr; B 'A is equivalent to B in form and meaning'<br>
+ A &ac; B 'A is equivalent to B in form, but not in meaning'<br>
+ A &cup; B 'A is combined with B'<br>
+ A &ni; B 'A contains B'
+ A &because; B 'A is justified by B'
